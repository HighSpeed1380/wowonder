## [ [3.0.0](https://github.com/infobip/infobip-api-php-client/releases/tag/3.0.0) ] - 2021-03-23

üéâ **NEW Major Version of `infobip-api-php-client`.**

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT NOTE:** This release contains breaking changes!

In this release, the infobip-api-php-client library is vastly changed and modernized. It is auto-generated and completely different from the previous version, so we do not provide an upgrade guide from 2.x to 3.x because such a document will be a similar size as the library itself.
